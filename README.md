## Run the Tests

Most of the exercises in this repo can be run as a test suite by doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/amd/HPCTrainingExamples && \
cd HPCTrainingExamples && \
cd tests && \
./runTests.sh
```
You can also run a subset of the whole test suite by specifying the subset you are interested in as an input to the `runTests.sh` script. For instance: `./runTests.sh --pytorch`. To see a full list of the possible subsets that can be run: `./runTests.sh --help`.

**NOTE**: tests can also be run manually from their respective directories, provided the necessary modules have been loaded and they have been compiled appropriately.
